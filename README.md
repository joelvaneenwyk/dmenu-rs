# dmenu-rs - dynamic menu

dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.

dmenu-rs is a 1:1 port of dmenu rewritten in Rust. It looks, feels, and runs pixel-for-pixel exactly the same.

It also has plugin support for easy modification.

## State of the project

The master branch is a stable, feature complete product. It it not unmaintained; it's finished.

There is a __small__ and ever-shrinking chance that this will be updated or overhauled in the distant future. It is much more likely that I will write a spiritual successor from scratch, but that won't happen until at least 2023.

## Why Rust?

### Inspiration

This project started with [`dmenu-calc`](https://github.com/sumnerevans/menu-calc).
Initially, I wanted much more function than what is provided by `bc`. However, I
found the bottleneck to be a lack of functionality and mod-ability in `dmenu(1)`
itself. So, the choice I had was to either mod `dmenu(1)` or rewrite it. Because
dmenu source is horrendously annoying to read, I decided to rewrite it in a
language which lends itself to writing code that is easier to modify. There are
other languages for this, but I like Rust.

### Improvements

As mentioned earlier, `dmenu-rs` runs exactly the same as `dmenu`. However, there
are some significant performance enhancements under the hood. The most impactful
is memory usage: `dmenu-rs` uses 21.65% less memory<sup>[1]</sup>, while managing it much
more safely __without__ any performance impacts. The other large improvement is
plugin support; read below.

## Plugins

dmenu-rs leverages rust crates `overrider` and `proc_use` to provide an easy to
write and powerful plugin system. The end-result are plugins which are dead-simple
to enable.
For a list of available plugins and more info on
enabling plugins, run `make plugins`.
For more info on developing plugins, read the [plugin guide](src/plugins/README.md).

## Requirements

- Xlib header files
- Cargo / rustc
- A working C compiler

## Installation

### Standalone

Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build dmenu:

```bash
make
```

Then, to install (if necessary as root):

```bash
make install
```

### Distros

dmenu-rs is available from the following sources:

- [Arch AUR - stable branch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dmenu-rs/)
- [Arch AUR - development branch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dmenu-rs-git/)

If you'd like for this to be available on another distro, raise an issue
or submit a pull request with a README change pointing to the released
package.

## Running dmenu

See the man page for details. For a quick test, run:
```make test```
